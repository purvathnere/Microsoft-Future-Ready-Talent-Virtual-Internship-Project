The current online presence of the Dental Department at People's Hospital lacks a cohesive, user-friendly, and comprehensive webpage to effectively inform and engage patients. This project aims to address this gap by developing a detailed and interactive webpage. The new webpage will streamline the appointment booking process, provide clear information about dental services and facilities, and enhance patient experience with engaging content and easy navigation. This opportunity will not only improve patient satisfaction and accessibility but also elevate the hospital's digital footprint in the healthcare sector.

By providing a centralized platform with detailed information, easy navigation, and an efficient appointment booking system, the project aims to enhance patient experience and satisfaction. The solution is clearly mapped to the problem statement, ensuring that the new webpage effectively meets the identified needs and improves the overall functionality of the hospital's online presence.
